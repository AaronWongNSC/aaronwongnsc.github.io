After spending 4-5 years learning about data science on my own, I applied to take a sabbatical so that I can formalize that knowledge and try to put it to work. Although my sabbatical technically doesn't start until July 1, 2020, in light of being stuck at home a lot right now, I've decided to start to organize a few of the things that I'm going to be trying to accomplish during my 6 months away from campus.

### Who am I?

I'm a math professor at Nevada State College.
