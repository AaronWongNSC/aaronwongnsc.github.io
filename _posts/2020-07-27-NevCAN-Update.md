I just got access to the data set last week, and I'm starting to try to build out plots as per my colleagues' requests. I've found the data itself to be a little bit tough to work with, but that's due primarily to how the data is stored. I'm not sure that the data is clean, and it's hard to get data for specific months when it's stored as weekly data. So I'm currently checking in to see whether it would be preferable to keep to the weekly data or switch over to the daily data and do some sort of direct conversion. I really just have to wait for feedback on that one.
