I took a deeper dive into the documentation for categories, and I discovered something that is making me pause for a bit. Apparently, the purpose of categories was to create some sort of folder structure in the website. I was approaching it more as an "advanced tag" situation, where the overall structure was still flat but the categories would form a virtual nesting organization. For example, all of the Data Science from Scratch posts could be found by looking at the categories and tracing the pattern of learning to books to Data_Science_From_Scratch. But this feels very different from having the categories lead to nested folders.

So at this point, I'm going to step away from playing around with this but will maybe come back to it later.
