It's been a few weeks now with SNHD. It's been a little bit slow getting things up and running, but things are starting to pick up now.

I've remained involved with the dashboard. Some requests have come in to provide more/better information for various stakeholders, and I've made a few more changes to the dashboard. I also refactored things a bit to make them more consistent and easier to follow. The current bottleneck is that I don't have direct access to the server (which is fine) and so I submit the updates on their local GitLab and the have to wait a little while for it to be loaded and tested. Apparently, their test server went down when they tried to put in my last update (which doesn't really make sense, and I think the problem is elsewhere on the server), so they're troubleshooting that now.

I have started to get to know a few more people on the team. From them, I'm starting to get a bit more insight into how they operate and the types of things they're looking at. Right now, I'm playing the role of an information gatherer. They've asked me to look into a number of programs/systems that they are thinking about implementing. So that's what I've been spending a lot of the last week doing. So far, the list of things to investigate is [Superset](https://airbnb.io/projects/superset/), [REDCap](https://www.project-redcap.org/), and [Apache NiFi](https://nifi.apache.org/). Based on this, it looks like they're definitely looking to grow/expand their capabilities and are possibly getting ready for a larger-scale migration of their backend.

In any event, this experience has been very good so far, and I'm looking forward to what I learn in the next few weeks.
