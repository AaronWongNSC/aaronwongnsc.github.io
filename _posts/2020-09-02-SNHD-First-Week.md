I've completed my first week with the Southern Nevada Health District, and so far I like how things are shaping up.

One of the interesting things is that they don't exactly have a specific role for me, and so right now I'm just floating around a little bit. They did request that I update their internal COVID dashboard to help them track [Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C)](https://www.cdc.gov/mis-c/), which ended up being a relatively easy task. I'm glad I spent the time to build the NevCAN data display, as it helped me to orient myself pretty quickly in someone else's code. I was able to make the update relatively easily, which is a nice little confidence booster.

They are kind of hoping to do some predictive modeling, which has me a little nervous because I don't have the background to be able to just dive into a project like that. I've been trying to do some reading on the general modeling concepts, but stepping into doing it for real (especially if people are going to be making health decisions based on it) feels intimidating. So I'm just going to have to wait and see where that one goes.
