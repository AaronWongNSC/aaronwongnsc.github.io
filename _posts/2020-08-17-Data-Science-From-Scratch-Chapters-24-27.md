The remainder of the book is probably not worth going into too deeply.

## Chapter 24: Databases and SQL

It's really not worth rewriting SQL in Python.

## Chapter 25: MapReduce

This concept is out of date at this point.

## Chapter 26: Data Ethics

This chapter is about data ethics, and it's mostly raising questions to think about rather than engaging in a deep discussion about data ethics itself. I actually wouldn't expect to find a deep discussion in this book, and the author is probably right to just talk briefly about it and suggest you look for discussion elsewhere.

## Chapter 27: Go Forth and Do Data Science

This is just a closing chapter that tells you where you can go to look for more things. I've already got enough resources to keep me busy for a while.
