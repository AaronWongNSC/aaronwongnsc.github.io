I connected with another colleague and was invited to join a call to hear about their environmental informatics project. The work they're doing is really curriculum-building, so I'm doubtful that any real research will come out of it (though I'm open to being surprised). At this point, it looks to be primarily data visualization stuff. The data is going into a Canvas shell (that I do not yet have access to), which will then become the basis for some type of environmental science curriculum.

My value to them at this point is the creation of graphs from their data sets. I don't know what exactly this means, but I did get a quick look at one of their data files and this looks like it should be some straightforward work.
