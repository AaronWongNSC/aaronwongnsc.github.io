Yesterday, I learned that the Southern Nevada Health District used R Shiny to create a webpage that they were using as a dashboard.

So today, I took the time to play around with the NevCAN data and see if I can push out something that works. I didn't do a whole lot of reconfiguring, and mostly just used some of the existing code I had from the graphs I already made. But this did give me a chance to think through the structures of how something like this might look, and I was able to complete what I set out to do: [Volumetric Water Content Graphs](https://aaron-wong-nsc.shinyapps.io/Volumetric_Water_Content/)
