The instructor posted a final exam review today, so I guess that means that we're done covering material. I've enjoyed the class, even though it has been a little slow. I definitely come away from this with a better sense of the underlying logic of databases and how they are constructed. I also got some more SQL practice (but we didn't do IF-THEN and CASE queries).

All that's really left to do is to work with the group to finish the project. We have a slightly janky student academic record system. But it's good enough. The structure isn't exactly the most organized, and in some ways we lost the plot a little bit. Many of the details we have are unnecessary for the final product, but that's fine.

The next course has posted some materials, so I'll probably start to dive into that one even though the semester hasn't officially started yet.
