The course is now officially over. Everything is graded and the final score is 94% for the course. It was a pretty easy course overall for me. And the grading scale is such that even with the group project ending up being somewhat of a mess, the grade for that was still a solid B.

What are the main takeaways for me?

 - I now have a deeper understanding of the setup of relational databases through ER diagrams.
 - I feel far more confident in my SQL.
 - I'm slightly more familiar with ideas related to other database structures (XML and NoSQL).

And that's pretty much it.

The statistics with R course has fully come into view now, and it's basically going to be a project course. There is a textbook and we're going to be able to work through chapters of our choice (I'm going to try to do them all, but I don't know if there's enough time), but this seems like something that will be graded fairly lightly, and so that part of it just seems like an independent reading course. There are some videos that he provides that go with the content, but there's not a ton there. It's mostly just what you can get out of it yourself.
