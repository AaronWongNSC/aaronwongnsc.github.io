After playing around for a few days, I've decided to bring my efforts to a close on the [COVID Statistics by County](https://aaronwongnsc.github.io/files/CovidInformation-NYT.html) page. It is now a bit more flexible in what it shows. I don't think there's much more to learn regarding this particular visualization method. Some of the code is definitely sloppy and can be cleaned up (especially the naming and the calculation of the running averages), but I'm going to just let that go. It's not important enough for me to refine this code.
