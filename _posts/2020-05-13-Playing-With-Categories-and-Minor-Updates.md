I spent about an hour trying to work through the details of the tag cloud code to think about how I would like to do that with categories. Tye primary difference with the categories is that I want to be able to have it sort out into sub-categories. For example, if I have the category as ```learning Data_Science_from_Scratch```, I want the page that shows the posts in the ```learning``` category to have all the ```Data_Science_from_Scratch``` posts grouped together.

This is not conceptually difficult, but I found myself struggling a bit with getting the right variable names. Some of the times I thought I was trying to get just a tag, I ended up getting another full copy of the blog inside of the blog. So there's some sort of conceptual gap that I'm fighting with where I don't quite have it clear in my head what variables are what. This is one of the downsides of starting with the basic blog page instead of starting from scratch and building the pages through GitHub instead of on my computer, first.

I think I can figure it out with just a little bit more time. So I'll probably come back to that in another couple days and think about it some more.

In the meantime, I've adjusted the padding on the sides of the page because it felt a little too squished on my smaller monitor. I've also adjusted the pagination to be 7 posts per page. I will probably have to do something about the "Previous Posts" to limit them to maybe 10-15 posts and call it "Recent Posts" instead. But I can already see this space getting crowded and that I should probably want to get the categories to work to help with organization. At some point, I'm probably going to want to also have a page for projects or something.
