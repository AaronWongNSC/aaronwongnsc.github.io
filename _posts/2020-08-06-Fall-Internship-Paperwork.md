I've confirmed with the Southern Nevada Health District that I will be volunteering with them for about 20 hours per week during the Fall semester. And this is starting off with some paperwork stuff. Even though I probably won't start until August 24, I'm trying to make sure everything is in place as soon as I can get it there.

There's a website called servnv.org, which is some sort of state volunteerism portal. I haven't really explored what it is, but from the information I had to fill out, it seems like this is also a place where they gather names for people who can serve in the event of some sort of emergency situation. I'll have to dig into it a bit more when I find the time.

I also told them that one of my goals was to understand what they do and also understand the skills that someone would need in order to get started volunteering with them or working on projects with them. It sounds like they have a lot of needs, and that if we can figure out where we need our students to be when they get started, that they would have a lot of work to do (especially in light of the COVID data, but even without it).

Even though I'll be volunteering with them, I'll still be working mostly from home. I'll probably need to go in a bunch during the first few days while I'm getting oriented with their systems, but working from home is the norm for them (which makes sense, since they are a health organization). I still don't know what this is going to look like, but I'm looking forward to finding out.
