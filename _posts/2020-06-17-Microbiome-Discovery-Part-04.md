Part 4 of ["Microbiome Discovery"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOPiWVjg6aTzsA53N19YqJQeZpSCH9QPc) is an overview of the QIIME pipeline.

## QIIME

QIIME is a tool that is used to do most of the computational work in this area. (Or at least, it was at the time the video was made. At this point, QIIME2 exists, which does the same type of things but using a slightly different structure.) It includes processes to handle the quality control, calculating different measures of diversity, and creating plots/images to communicate that information.
