I spent a little bit of time this morning looking at the structure that's used to actually create this blog. Right now, there are three types of pages:
 * Main index page: This is the index.html page that shows up first. The file for this is found in the main folder.
 * About page: This is the page that's linked at the top. This is generated through the about.md file.
 * Posts: These are the individual blog posts. These are generated by the files in the `/_posts/` folder.
